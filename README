e-mail me with any questions: linuxbash8@gmail.com

Directions: Move the drjava.jar, JSH.java, jsh script and EasyReader.class into a directory of your choice

Then, run:
$javac -classpath ".:drjava.jar" JSH.java  assuming you are running this from the directory with all the files

then, run ./jsh and enjoy. 
If you have files that you want to preload, i.e SomeClass.java, run $./jsh SomeClass.java SomeOtherClass.java
for each class you want to preload.
